## üöÄ Project Overview
- Automated deployment of a **highly available website** using Terraform.  
- Infrastructure includes **VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, and Security Groups**.  
- Modular setup with **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**, **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**, and **RDS** for database management.  
- EC2 instances configured with managed access via **Key Pairs**.  
- Terraform backend configured with **S3 remote state** to enable **team collaboration** and **state locking**.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Components
- **VPC** ‚Äì Custom Virtual Private Cloud with public & private subnets.  
- **Subnets** ‚Äì Separate public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.  
- **NAT Gateway** ‚Äì For secure outbound traffic from private subnets.  
- **Security Groups** ‚Äì Fine-grained access control for EC2, RDS, and ELB.  
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** ‚Äì Ensures high availability by scaling EC2 instances.  
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** ‚Äì Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.  
- **Amazon RDS** ‚Äì Managed relational database for application data.  
- **EC2 Instances** ‚Äì Hosts the web application.  
- **S3 Backend** ‚Äì Remote backend for Terraform state management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/antique-cafe-website.git
   cd antique-cafe-website
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Generates an execution plan**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the changes**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Destroy after completion**
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```


## üë• Team Collaboration

Remote backend is configured with **Amazon S3** for storing the Terraform state.  
Team members can safely work together without overwriting each other's changes.
